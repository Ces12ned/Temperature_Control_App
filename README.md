# Temperature_Control_App

<em>
Nowadays the development of new and better technologies focused on the health care sector is facing new challenges due to the high demand for these services. Some of
the current issues are the limited capacity to deliver results in reduced times, as well as the need for trained personnel and large, specialized physical spaces, problems that limit access to these technologies in sectors of the population.

  
Microtechnology, especially the development of Lab-On-a-Chip (LOC) devices in conjunction with control theory and engineering, shows an attractive, reliable and low-
cost technological solution for solving these problems, as well as the possibility of new technological developments in other areas.

This work shows the development and implementation of a temperature control system in a microfluidic platform with the purpose of regulating the internal tempera-
ture of microdroplets generated in microfluidic devices. The objective is, to carry out the genetic amplification technique known as RT-LAMP or isothermal amplification
mediated by reverse transcriptase loop.

The implementation of the control system was carried out by means of an application developed in MATLAB in serial communication with an Arduino UNO board, which contains the design of two controllers. It incorporates the design of a classic PI control with Anti-WindUp and an advanced GPC control with restrictions. To send
and receive signals on the Arduino UNO board, a PCB was designed that contains the electronics to condition the sensor and actuator signals.

For validation of the control system, simulations were carried out in MATLAB and later the data obtained with the experimental implementation were matched. The
results obtained show good behaviour for both controllers and therefore validate the design and implementation of the control system for regulating the temperature in the
microfluidic device. </em>
